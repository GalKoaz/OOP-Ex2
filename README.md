<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Exercise 2 Object-Oriented Programming

This Exercise is dedicated to the design and implementation of data structures and algorithms on graphs (directed and weighted). As usual, it is recommended to start planning the Exercise (without a code) and only after you have a basic plan you should move on to the implementation phase of the code.

The Exercise are defined as interfaces in the epic package, you need to plan and implement two really key ones:
Interface of a weighted directed graph
Interface of algorithms on graphs (weighted tuners).

When the Exercise is checked through three public static functions, place fences in the Ex2.java class - note that you must complete the three steps below - through which your Exercise will be checked. Directed Graph Class - should support uploading json files, please note: We have attached some json files of graphs for you.

## The Algorithm

Our offline algorithm for elevators is designed as follows:

here the algo if have


---------

## Code Details


Unified Modeling Language (UML) :

here will be the UML


Our class Building reading a json with containing a building with minimum floor and maximum floor, list  of elevators
we added a numbers of elevators function to help us in later.  Elevator class contains all information about each elevator speed close time doors etc.. 
Calls class is reading the csv and write output csv contain list of calls with all the calls in the csv, in additional we have set target function that re-write the (-1) value with the new elevator the algorithm choose for.
in the main class the heart of the project contain update time function that over of all the new calls that the algorithm decide to insert to the list, and the major function allocate elevator which the heart of the algorithm calculate the best elevator to give us with all parameters and calculated time between all elevators we got in the case.

## Results

Our best Results:

Information: the first column is the cases with the B1,B2,B3,B4,B5, the second column is the call cases a,b,c,d the third column is the average waiting time of all calls the forth column is  the number of incomplete calls mains that the algorithm is missed a calls.

As you can see our results after analyzing the code, after going over all the results for the different cases we decided to present the best results for us
that results give us a boost in motivation for develop and improve the code to maximum performance with the minimum of issues or errors.
